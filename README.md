# Design-and-verification-of-UART
Designed and verilog based UART and verified using system verilog.

Designed RTL modules of UART transmitter and receiver in Verilog HDL with 8-bit serial data transmission capability.

Implemented a SystemVerilog-based testbench with driver, environment, generator, and interface components, utilizing constrained random test cases to effectively validate the UART functionality.

Design and testing folder contains all the files used for design of UART the screensort attached shows transmitted and received data.
